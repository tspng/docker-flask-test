# Minimal Python Flask & NGINX Docker Starter

Dockerized Python Flask test Application with NGINX reverse proxy server.

Build the Docker images and run the containers:

    $ docker-compose build
    $ docker-compose up

Test on the exposed port 8080:

    http://localhost:8080

Note: Depending on your network configuration, you need to change the ip that you have to connect to.
